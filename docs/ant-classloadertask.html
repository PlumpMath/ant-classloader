<p>
Welcome on the site for the proposed <b>Ant Tasks <i>Classloader</i></b> and <b><i>ClassloaderReport</i></b>.
</p><p>
Some people have asked me in the last months to provide the tasks for a trial. Here they are in the proposed version for Ant 1.7. I will provide this version in the next weeks as a updated patch of the Feature Request.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
If one has no problems with classpathes resp. classloaders he has not to read on.<br/> 
However, there are some situations, where previous Ant classloading requires annoying workarounds. One of the more serious is dealing with Ant in environments where all tools (including Ant) are controlled by a versioning system; it is not easy to "install" jars for optional tasks.<br/>
&lt;classloaderreport&gt; will most likely be used for debugging or evaluation reasons.
<h2>Help</h2>
Please help us to make the tasks more useful.<br/>
As long as this tasks are not commited to Ant's repository, please report bugs or requests for enhancements to <b>info</b>@<b>jtools</b>.<b>org</b>.<br/>
If you find the tasks useful, vote for the <a target="_blank" href="http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28228">feature request</a> in Ant's bugzilla.
